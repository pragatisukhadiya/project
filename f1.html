               <br><br> <h2>Weighted Votes</h2>
                <p>Generally one person has one vote. However, in certain voting including voting of creditors in insolvency cases, different voters have different weightages based on their investment or some other criteria.<br>
                 This feature ensure that the poll creator does not have to do offline weight allocation to votes which is a very tedious and error prone task.
                 At Weighted Vote, we believe that not all votes are created equal—because not all voices carry the same level of expertise, stake, or responsibility. Our platform empowers organizations, communities, and decision-making bodies to implement a more nuanced and fair voting system by assigning different weights to votes based on predefined criteria such as experience, investment, or role. Whether you're managing a boardroom, a DAO, or a collaborative project, we help ensure that every decision reflects both consensus and competency. Our mission is to bring transparency, balance, and impact to every vote cast.

                <p>Vote record in a superior feature than Voter Receipt as it provides vote record direct from the servers. Hence in case votes has been tampered with post voting, the voter would come to  Know .Transparency is the best antidote against malpractices.<br>
                    Individual voting record A vote record refers to the official documentation of how individuals or representatives cast their votes in an election or on specific issues. In public elections, vote records typically show whether a person participated in the election, but not who they voted for, ensuring privacy and confidentiality. In legislative settings, vote records are more transparent and show how lawmakers voted on particular bills or motions. These records are important for accountability, allowing the public to track the decisions made by their elected officials. They also serve as a historical reference, helping researchers and analysts understand political trends and policy decisions over time.

                <p>One of the perceived risk of online system is hacking - specially hacking while transit. There is a risk that vote data would be tampered with while the data flows from voter mobile to our central server.<br>

                    To eliminate this risk, we have built a feature where our server ask for confirmation from voter before his vote is recorded.

                <p>Real-time results refer to the immediate or live updating of information as events unfold, without significant delay. In the context of elections, sports, or data monitoring systems, real-time results provide instant updates that keep the public or stakeholders informed with the most current information. For example, during an election, real-time result systems display vote counts as they are reported from polling stations, offering transparency and timely insights. This technology is made possible through advanced data processing, internet connectivity, and automated systems, allowing for faster decision-making, improved engagement, and greater trust in the accuracy and fairness of the process.

                <p>
                    Result calculation timing refers to the duration or process involved in computing and declaring the final outcome of an event, such as an election, examination, or competition. In the context of elections, it involves collecting, verifying, and counting votes from various polling stations before officially announcing the results. The efficiency of result calculation timing is crucial, as faster processing enhances transparency and public trust. With the use of electronic systems and real-time data transmission, the time taken to calculate results has significantly decreased in many sectors. However, accuracy remains the top priority, and systems are often designed to ensure both speed and reliability during the calculation process.
